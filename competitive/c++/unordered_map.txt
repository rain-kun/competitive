to find duplicate in an array use unordered_map
header: unordered_map
impliment: unodered map<string, int> umap;
            umap["string"] = int
traversing: for (auto x :umap)
            cout<<x.first<<""x.second<<endl;

            for(i = umap.begin();i<map.end();i++){//code
              here i is a pointer to first element of umap
            }

methods:
    at(): This function in C++ unordered_map returns the reference to the value with the element as key k.
    begin(): Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the container in the unordered_map container
    end(): Returns an iterator pointing to the position past the last element in the container in the unordered_map container
    bucket(): Returns the bucket number where the element with the key k is located in the map.
    bucket_count: bucket_count is used to count the total no. of buckets in the unordered_map. No parameter is required to pass into this function.
    bucket_size: Returns number of elements in each bucket of the unordered_map.
    count(): Count the number of elements present in an unordered_map with a given key.
    equal_range: Return the bounds of a range that includes all the elements in the container with a key that compares equal to k.
